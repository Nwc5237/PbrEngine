# PbrEngine
Doing some physically based lighting in OpenGL

TODO:
(Mostly model loading stuff for pbr workflow)

-Add support for smooth shading (s 1 or s off)

-handle object groups (o command).

-add warning for quad face triangles

-check texture type (png has alpha channel so the stbi load is different)

-add support for multiple materials on an object (newmtl)

-calculate tangents and bitangents in the model loader

-read for metalness and roughness maps
